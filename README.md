## theGreatBefore
TheGreatBefore is a javaScript web game that I designed and created when I first started learning to code. 
This is still a work in progress. Only 2 levels have been built and some parts are buggy. I might refactor the code or redesign the assets/levels when I have inspirations.

Built with p5.js, p5.sound, p5.play.
